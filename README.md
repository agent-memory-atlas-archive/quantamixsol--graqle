# GraQle

**Give your AI agents a memory of how your organisation works - and check every decision before they act.**

## What GraQle does

1. **Remembers.** Turns your code, documents, policies and decisions into one connected knowledge graph that lasts beyond a chat session.
2. **Checks.** Before an agent acts, the Decision Assurance Gate checks the action and answers **EXECUTE, REPLAN, HOLD, REJECT or ESCALATE** - with the reason and a signed record.
3. **Shares.** One graph serves a whole team of agents - Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot - each with its own permissions and its own files.

Works with any model: Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, Gemini and more - or fully offline.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install graqle

graq scan docs ./policies          # documents, policies, ADRs -> graph
graq scan repo .                   # code -> the same graph
graq learn knowledge "vendor DPA must be signed before any data access"
graq run "what approval is needed for a large refund?"
# -> answer + confidence + the exact sources it used
```

Connect it to your AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code):

```bash
graq init        # detects your IDE and wires GraQle in
```

PDF, DOCX, PPTX and XLSX: `pip install "graqle[docs]"`.

## Check every decision

Most AI tools give you one confidence number. GraQle asks separate questions before an agent acts - and a good answer to one never hides a failed answer to another:

- **Allowed?** Policy valid, actor authorised, evidence current, arguments exactly the approved ones. Any "no" stops the action.
- **Consistent?** Contradicting facts are tracked in the graph, and a change updates every decision that depends on it.
- **Sure enough?** Confidence is measured per dimension, not blended into one score.
- **On track?** Unreliable step sequences are sent back to replan within a retry budget.
- **Who approves?** Authority is checked for the action's impact level.

| Answer | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `EXECUTE` | Everything checks out. Impossible after any failed check or error. |
| `REPLAN` | Make a better plan and try again. |
| `HOLD` | Something important is missing; wait for it. |
| `REJECT` | Not allowed, or contradicted by the evidence. |
| `ESCALATE` | A human decides. |

```python
from graqle.assurance.gate import DecisionAssuranceGate

verdict = gate.evaluate(candidate, ctx)
verdict.outcome         # EXECUTE | REPLAN | HOLD | REJECT | ESCALATE
verdict.decisive_rule   # which rule decided
verdict.reason_codes    # why
```

**Every decision leaves a sealed record:** a signed, hash-chained provenance event, exportable to W3C PROV-O and checkable with SHACL, so an auditor can verify it with standard tools. The gate is **off by default**: installing or upgrading GraQle changes nothing until you switch it on.

**Turn it on, per project:**

1. Set `GRAQLE_DAG_ENABLED=true` in the environment where GraQle runs (or in your `.env`).
2. Provide the required settings. GraQle ships no thresholds, salts or keys: you choose them. Start from the `GRAQLE_DAG_*` section of [`.env.example`](./.env.example) and fill in every placeholder (salt, thresholds, signing key id and version, calibrator version, and the others listed there). Put the values in the environment, or in a private file at `GRAQLE_DAG_SECRETS_PATH` (default `.graqle/graqle_secrets.yaml`); the environment wins.
3. Start as usual. If a required value is missing, GraQle raises a configuration error that names it the first time the gate settings load. There is no silent fallback.

Check it: `python -c "from graqle.assurance.settings import is_dag_enabled; print(is_dag_enabled())"` prints `True`.

To switch it off again, unset the flag or set it to `false`. Details: [operating the gate](./docs/dag/ground-truth-addendum.md).

## One memory for a team of agents

Several agents on one codebase usually means several copies of the same graph in memory. GraQle can hold it once:

```bash
# where the graph lives
graq mcp serve --transport http --port 8765 --config graqle.yaml --allowed-roots /path/to/projects

# in each agent session (.mcp.json)
{ "mcpServers": { "graqle": { "command": "graq", "args": ["mcp", "relay", "--url", "http://127.0.0.1:8765"] } } }
```

- **Less memory.** Each session runs a small relay instead of a full copy ([measured](./scripts/cr_infra_02c_measure_rss.output.txt) on a 20,000-node graph: 3 separate servers 687 MB, shared server + 3 relays 493 MB).
- **Learning is shared at once** across all sessions.
- **Each session keeps its own gates and its own files** - file work happens on each user's own machine.
- **Teammates connect** over an SSH tunnel, or HTTPS with a token.
- **Several projects, separate graphs** on one server (Team and Enterprise).

### Turn on the decision gate (opt-in, baseline tier)

The decision gate is off unless `GRAQLE_DAG_ENABLED` is set; with it off nothing changes. Turn it on:

1. Create an ed25519 signing key (PEM, mode `0600`) and a key manifest that lists its public key
   (`graqle.assurance.key_manifest_store.save_manifest`), plus a coverage policy file.
2. Set `GRAQLE_DAG_ENABLED=1` and the required `GRAQLE_DAG_*` settings: `SIGNING_KEY_ID`,
   `SIGNING_KEY_VERSION`, `SIGNING_KEY_PATH`, `COVERAGE_POLICY_PATH`, `CONFIG_SALT`, `CAP_VALUE`,
   `HG05_POISONING_THRESHOLD`, `HG07_MATERIALITY_THRESHOLD`, `CALIBRATOR_VERSION`,
   `TRAJECTORY_ESTIMATOR`, `MAX_RETRY_BUDGET`, `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_WINDOW`, `SCOPE_KEY_FIELDS_REF`,
   `MERGE_PRIORITY_REF`. There are no built-in values for these; you choose them.
3. Register the actors that may take MEDIUM-risk calls (for example `GRAQLE_RBAC_ACTORS_JSON`). An
   actor with no registered role is closed by hard gate HG-06.
4. Start your process. The packaged default runtime provider is registered at start-up. If it
   cannot be built the process fails at start-up with an error naming `register_runtime`; supply
   your own provider with `graqle.assurance.adapter.register_runtime(provider)` if you need one.

Baseline-tier decisions are governed by rule `DAG-RT-BASELINE-ADMIT`. No projection score,
reliability or residual risk is computed or recorded for them. EXECUTE only when risk is LOW,
impact is zero and all hard gates pass; anything else is HOLD (`DAG-RT-NO-EVIDENCE`) or, when a
hard gate fails, REJECT. MEDIUM and above routing requires explicit configuration. Every decision
is written as a signed, hash-chained provenance event; if it cannot be written the call is not
executed.

This is a policy-scoped authorisation at evidence tier BASELINE. It is not informed by the graph
and is not a safety verification. Evidence-fed scoring arrives in 0.88 (CR-DAG-088-1).
`python scripts/dag_wheel_e2e.py` runs these steps against the built wheel in a clean virtualenv.

## Trust

- **Local-first, no telemetry.** The graph is a file you control; nothing phones home.
- **Secure by default.** The server needs authentication unless you explicitly switch on local development mode; graph uploads can never silently overwrite each other.
- **Signed releases.** Sigstore-signed wheels, CycloneDX SBOM, reproducible builds.
- **Regulated work.** Audit trail and evidence exports for your own EU AI Act file - GraQle provides evidence, it does not claim to make you compliant. [Details](./docs/compliance/eu-ai-act/)
